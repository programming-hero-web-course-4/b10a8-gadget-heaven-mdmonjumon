## Here are some React fundamental concepts used in Gadget Heaven project:
- #### useState()  : for State Management.
- #### useEffect() : for manage Side Effects.
- #### React Router : (react-router-dom) Handles page navigation (<Link/>, useNavigate, <NavLink/ >).

## I have used Local Storage for handling and managing data.
